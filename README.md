# Modern JavaScript Deep Dive 🚀

This repository is my personal **JavaScript fundamentals refresh**.  
Even after building full-stack applications (PERN stack) and working with JS frameworks like **React** and **Node.js** during my internship and personal projects, I believe **revisiting core concepts** helps me write cleaner, more efficient, and bug-free code.

---

## 📌 Why This Repo Exists
- To **strengthen core JavaScript knowledge** that powers every framework.
- To **practice writing pure JS code** without framework abstractions.
- To have a **quick reference** for interviews and future projects.

---

## 📂 Structure
Each folder contains:
- **`.js` files** → working code examples I wrote for each concept.
- **`README.md`** → my own notes and explanations in plain English.

### Topics Covered
1. Basics (variables, data types, operators, loops)
2. Functions & Scope
3. Objects & Prototypes
4. Data Structures (arrays, maps, sets)
5. Advanced Functions (closures, `this`, binding)
6. Error Handling
7. Asynchronous JavaScript (callbacks, promises, async/await)
8. DOM & Browser APIs

---

## 🛠 How I Study
1. Read the topic from [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/).
2. Rewrite the concept in **my own words** in the folder `README.md`.
3. Write and test code examples in `.js` files.
4. Commit each topic separately to track learning progress.

## 💡 Why Fundamentals Matter
Frameworks like React, Express, and Node.js are **built on top of JavaScript**.  
By understanding the underlying language deeply:
- I debug faster
- I avoid hidden pitfalls
- I can switch between frameworks easily
